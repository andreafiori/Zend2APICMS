Zend2 Comment System
=======================

Introduction
------------
Zend framework 2 web application with a form to post a comments on a single web page.
The frontend has <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap 3</a> integrated.
This is a demo to show the most common Zend features.


Installation
------------

Get a working copy of this project is to clone the repository
and use `composer` to install dependencies using the `create-project` command:

    php composer.phar self-update
    php composer.phar install
	
The .sql file with the MySQL database is on the sql directory.

This index.php file on the root allows to use this application on a shared hosting but I've updated the Basepath.php file on the Zend framwework.

Rename the a.htaccess file to .htaccess. I've renamed it to use on my local XAMPP.
